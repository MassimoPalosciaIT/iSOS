Bleeding;"1. Apply pressure to the wound using any available material to stop or slow the bleeding.\n\nBy acting as a ""plug"", you help prevent blood loss. The pressure helps the blood to clot and cease bleeding.";2. Call an ambulance as soon as possible.;3. Maintain pressure on the wound until help arrives.;;;
Asthma attack;1. Assist the person in finding a comfortable position and help them use their inhaler.\n\nWhen someone has an asthma attack, their airways narrow, making it difficult for them to breathe. An inhaler relaxes the muscles, allowing the airways to expand and ease their breathing.;2. Reassure the person. If the attack becomes severe, or if they don't have their inhaler, call emergency services as soon as possible.\n\nA mild attack should ease within a few minutes. If it doesn’t, they can continue to take their inhaler.

Do not leave them, in case the attack becomes severe quickly. If you can’t call 999, get someone else to do it.;;;;
Burn;1. Cool the burn under cold running water for at least 20 minutes.\n\nCooling the burn will reduce pain, swelling, and the risk of scarring. The sooner and longer a burn is cooled with cold running water, the less the impact of the injury.;2. After the burn has been cooled, cover it with cling film or a clean plastic bag.\n\nThis helps prevent infection by keeping the area clean. Cling film or plastic won’t stick to the burn and will reduce pain by keeping air from the skin’s surface.;3. Call emergency services if necessary.\n\nThe burn may need urgent medical treatment. If you’re in any doubt, seek medical advice, and always seek medical advice for a baby or child who has been burned.;;;
Heart attack;1. The person may have persistent, vice-like chest pain, which may spread to their arms, neck, jaw, back, or stomach.

A heart attack can be very serious and requires immediate attention.;2. Help the person to sit down. Ensure they are comfortable—for example, sitting on the floor and leaning against a chair or a wall. Sitting will ease the strain on the heart.

Call emergency as soon as possible. A stroke needs immediate attention. The faster a person having a stroke gets medical help, the less damage there will be.;4. Reassure them while you wait for the ambulance.;;
Allergic reaction;1. The person may develop a rash, itchiness, or swelling on their hands, feet, or face.\n\nTheir breathing may slow down. They may also vomit or have diarrhoea.

The reaction may cause swelling of their airway, causing them to stop breathing.;3.

Make small holes at the edge of the blister and gently push out the fluid.;3. Apply antibiotic ointment and put on a bandage.;4. If possible, take steps to protect the area from further rubbing or pressure.;
Sprain;The first thing to do is make sure that the injured person stops any unnecessary activity, as moving can make the injury worse.;If emergency care is not needed, follow these first aid steps:;1. Keep the limb as still as possible and apply a cold pack.;2. Elevate the injured part if you can do so safely and use NSAIDs for pain.;;
Frostbite;Treating frostbite involves carefully and gradually warming the affected area. If at all possible, it should only be done by a medical professional.\n\nIf that’s not possible, or while you’re waiting for an ambulance, you can begin first aid for frostbite.;1. Get out of the cold and put the affected area in warm water (98 to 105 degrees) for 20 to 30 minutes.;2. Do not rub the affected area and do not use sources of dry heat (e.g., heating pads, fireplace).;3. For fingers and toes, you can put clean cotton balls between them after they have warmed up.;4. Loosely wrap the area with bandages and use Tylenol (acetaminophen) or Advil (ibuprofen) for pain.;5. Get medical attention as soon as possible.
Bee Stings;Bee stings can hurt a lot but are only a minor problem for many people. However, for people who are allergic to bee venom, a sting can be deadly.\n\nAn allergy can develop at any time—that’s why it’s important to always watch for an allergic reaction after a bee sting.;1. Get the stinger out immediately. This will prevent additional venom from getting into the person. To remove a stinger, it is best to use a straight-edged object such as a credit card to scrape the stinger out of the skin. Avoid squeezing the venom sac with tweezers or your fingers, as this can inject venom into the skin. ;2. Wash the area with soap and water.;3. Use a cold pack to help with the swelling at the site. However, do not apply ice directly to the skin. ;4. Use an allergy medication or antihistamine (like Benadryl) to reduce swelling and itching. ;5. Use Tylenol (acetaminophen) or Advil (ibuprofen) for pain.
Eye Injuries;1. If an object is impaled in the eye, call emergency and DO NOT remove the object.;2. Cover both eyes with sterile dressings or eye cups to immobilize.;3.
