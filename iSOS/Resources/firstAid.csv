Bleeding;1. Apply pressure to the wound using any available material to stop or slow the bleeding.\n\nBy acting as a "plug", you help prevent blood loss. The pressure helps the blood to clot and cease bleeding.;2. Call an ambulance as soon as possible.;3. Maintain pressure on the wound until help arrives.;
Asthma attack;1. Assist the person in finding a comfortable position and help them use their inhaler.\n\nWhen someone has an asthma attack, their airways narrow, making it difficult for them to breathe. An inhaler relaxes the muscles, allowing the airways to expand and ease their breathing.;2. Reassure the person. If the attack becomes severe, or if they don't have their inhaler, call emergency services as soon as possible.\n\nA mild attack should ease within a few minutes. If it doesn’t, they can continue to take their inhaler. You should call 999 if they don't have their inhaler, if their inhaler has no effect, if they are becoming worse, or if they become unable to talk. Do not leave them, in case the attack becomes severe quickly. If you can’t call 999, get someone else to do it.;;
Burn;1. Cool the burn under cold running water for at least 20 minutes.\n\nCooling the burn will reduce pain, swelling, and the risk of scarring. The sooner and longer a burn is cooled with cold running water, the less the impact of the injury.;2. After the burn has been cooled, cover it with cling film or a clean plastic bag.\n\nThis helps prevent infection by keeping the area clean. Cling film or plastic won’t stick to the burn and will reduce pain by keeping air from the skin’s surface.;3. Call emergency services if necessary.\n\nThe burn may need urgent medical treatment. If you’re in any doubt, seek medical advice, and always seek medical advice for a baby or child who has been burned.;
Heart attack;1. The person may have persistent, vice-like chest pain, which may spread to their arms, neck, jaw, back, or stomach. This pain occurs because a blockage prevents blood from reaching the heart muscle. The pain will not ease with rest.\n\nCall Emergency Services. The person needs medical help as soon as possible. A heart attack can be very serious and requires immediate attention.;2. Help the person to sit down. Ensure they are comfortable—for example, sitting on the floor and leaning against a chair or a wall. Sitting will ease the strain on the heart. Having them on the floor also means they are less likely to hurt themselves if they collapse.;3. Reassure them while you wait for the ambulance.;
Fracture;1. Encourage the person to support the injury with their hand, or use a cushion or items of clothing to prevent unnecessary movement. Supporting the injury may help relieve pain and prevent further damage. If possible, support the limb above and below the injury.;2. Call Emergency as soon as possible.;3. Continue supporting the injury until help arrives.;
Diabetic emergency;1. Give them something sweet to eat or a non-diet drink.;2. Reassure the person. Most people will gradually improve, but if in doubt, call emergency services.;;
Epileptic seizure;1. The person has collapsed and is making sudden jerking movements. They may also have froth around their mouth.;2. Make them safe and prevent injury. Use a blanket or clothing to protect their head. Do not restrain them. Restraining them may cause injury to you or them. Let the seizure run its normal course. Remove objects that may injure them while they are having the seizure.;3. After the seizure, help the person to rest on their side with their head tilted back. This will make sure they keep breathing.;4. Call emergency services if necessary. The person needs urgent medical attention if:\n\n- It is their first seizure.\n- The seizure lasts longer than five minutes.\n- They have hurt themselves.\n- You are unsure as to the cause of the seizure.
Stroke;1. Carry out the FAST test:\n\n- Face: Is there weakness on one side of their face?\n- Arms: Can they raise both arms?\n- Speech: Is their speech easily understood?\n- Time: Time to call emergency.;2. Strokes usually happen because of a blockage of the blood supply to the brain. This damages part of the brain, which can affect people’s appearance, bodily functions, speech, and sight.;3. Call emergency as soon as possible. A stroke needs immediate attention. The faster a person having a stroke gets medical help, the less damage there will be.;4. Reassure them while you wait for the ambulance.
Allergic reaction;1. The person may develop a rash, itchiness, or swelling on their hands, feet, or face.\n\nTheir breathing may slow down. They may also vomit or have diarrhoea. Common causes of allergic reactions are pollen, stings and bites, latex and some food items, such as nuts, shellfish, eggs or dairy products.;2. Call emergency if you see these symptoms.\n\nThey need urgent medical assistance because an allergic reaction can affect someone very quickly, and is potentially very serious. The reaction may cause swelling of their airway, causing them to stop breathing.;3. If they have a known allergy, use their auto-injector.\n\nIf someone has a known allergy, they may have been prescribed an auto-injector. Follow the guidance on the packaging.;4. Reassure them and make them as comfortable as possible while you wait for the ambulance.\n\nTell the ambulance crew if the auto-injector has been used.
